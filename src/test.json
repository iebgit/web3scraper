             "\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adSpeaking to a packed house of the bitcoin faithful, who gave the pair a standing ovation at their introduction, Saylor and Wood laid out several political and technological reasons for their optimism about the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market value.",
             "On the political front, Saylor, whose company owns roughly $6 billion worth of bitcoin, said President Joe Biden\u2019s recent executive order directing various federal agencies to coordinate their approach to regulating the sector amounted to the \u201cpresident of the United States giving a green light to bitcoin.\u201d",
             "\u201cIf I scan the last 100 years of history [and ask] when was the last time the president of the United States directed the government to embrace a new asset class, the answer is never,\u201d Saylor said. He described the order as Biden telling different U.S. agencies to \u201cget educated on bitcoin and figure out how to get it incorporated into the government.\u201d",
             "Wood agreed that there has been growing political support for bitcoin in the U.S.",
             "\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the politics around bitcoin changing radically because it has become the single issue that some people are voting on, and this is becoming bipartisan,\u201d said Wood, who envisions bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030.",
             "Wood did sound one note of political caution, however, pointing to China\u2019s strong support of blockchain several years ago, only to eventually ban much of the activity around it in favor of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).",
             "\u201cI don\u2019t hear talk about that here and haven\u2019t heard much talk about \u2018hey, this is going to displace the dollar as the reserve currency of the world,\u2019\u201d said Wood. \u201cThat\u2019s very good we\u2019re not hearing that kind of rhetoric here. But I\u2019m sure as the elections evolve, someone will raise that as an issue.\u201d",
             "As for the technological forces driving adoption, Saylor and Wood pointed to the growing number of platforms integrating the Lightning Network as improving bitcoin\u2019s usefulness as a medium of exchange.",
             "\u201cI think every crypto exchange, if they\u2019re going to remain viable and competitive, they need to build Lightning into their exchange,\u201d said Saylor, citing Kraken and Cash App\u2019s recent announcements about incorporating the Lightning Network. (Shortly after Saylor and Wood's talk, popular no-fee trading app Robinhood (HOOD) announced in Miami that it, too, was integrating with Lightning.)",
             "Wood was similarly sanguine about the rapidly growing payments technology.",
             "\u201cI think we\u2019ll see an explosion of developers focused on Lightning Network,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis will be the missing link in terms of use case. Store of value \u2013 it\u2019s always been there [for bitcoin]. But means of exchange and unit of account now have much a better opportunity for bitcoin to dominate long term.\u201d",
             "Saylor said he thinks bitcoin\u2019s real potential will be realized when billions of people around the world have a mobile phone and an app with a Lightning wallet, and that wallet has some bitcoin on it as a store of value, and some U.S. dollars or digital euros or Chinese digital yuans on it as a medium of exchange.",
             "\u201cThen you\u2019ll see tens of trillions or hundreds of trillions of dollars all moving on Lightning rails secured [on] the Bitcoin network,\u201d said Saylor. \u201cThat\u2019s when people will wake up and realize, holy crap, this really is going to change the world.\u201d",

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has time and again rejected spot-based bitcoin ETFs, citing a lack of market surveillance and risk of manipulation.",

             "The 1933 act governing spot-based ETFs requires filing form 19B-4, detailing how the underlying asset is resistant to manipulation. Applications for the several futures-based ETFs approved since October 2021 were filed under the Investment company Act of 1940, which governs futures ETFs and doesn't require submission of Form 19B-4. Last year, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had said he favored futures-based funds over a spot bitcoin ETF, mentioning the 1940 act as appropriate for approving bitcoin futures-based instruments.",
             "\"The SEC approves Teucrium Bitcoin Futures ETF filed in 33Act structure. All previous BTC futures ETFs were in 40Act structure,\" Bloomberg's ETF analyst Henry Jim tweeted. \"Bottom line: This increases chances of a 'spot' bitcoin ETFs being approved as it would only be able to use the 33Act structure.\"",

             "However, regulation may be coming soon and that could keep hopes of a spot-based ETF alive, perhaps helping the market absorb shocks from Fed's aggressive monetary policy tightening.",

             "Speaking to attendees at an American University event, Yellen highlighted the extreme divergence of perceptions about crypto, saying that\u2019s often the case with \u201ctransformative\u201d technology.",
             "\u201cSome proponents speak as if the technology is so radically and beneficially transformative that the government should step back completely and let innovation take its course,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, skeptics see limited, if any, value in this technology and associated products and advocate that the government take a much more restrictive approach.\u201d",
             "She focused part of her speech on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), an area of interest for U.S. policymakers over the past few years.",
             "\"The development of our currency to its current form has been a dynamic process that took place over centuries. Today, monetary sovereignty and uniform currency have brought clear benefits for economic growth and stability. Our approach to digital assets must be guided by the appreciation of those benefits,\" Yellen said. \"Some have suggested a CBDC could be the next evolution in our currency. A recent report by the Federal Reserve opened a public dialogue about CBDCs and the potential benefits and risks that could be associated with issuing one in the U.S.\"",
             "Any potential CBDC design would have to address its impact on the financial system, ability to address financial crime and national security questions, privacy implications, ability to address macro policy and how it might interact with existing fiat currencies, stablecoins or other CBDCs, Yellen said.",
             "Pointing to U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on digital assets, Yellen said any potential CBDC would have to support the dollar's role in international markets.",
             "\"I don't yet know the conclusions we will reach, but we must be clear that issuing a CBDC would likely present a major design and engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months. So, I share the president's urgency in pulling forward research to understand the challenges and opportunities a CBDC could present to American interests,\" she said.",
             "Yellen highlighted five lessons she believes apply to Treasury's work on digital assets through her speech: the financial system \"benefits from responsible innovation,\" the potential harms to vulnerable individuals if regulation does not keep up with innovation, rules should focus on activities and their risks rather than technologies specifically, the U.S. benefits from the dollar's current role and regulators should work with industry in supporting responsible innovation.",
             "The Treasury secretary pointed to specific concerns around the existing crypto market, such as runs on stablecoins. She referenced last year's Iron Finance run, when its TITAN token fell in price, which led to its IRON stablecoin losing its peg to the U.S. dollar.",
             "\"This is not hypothetical. A stablecoin run occurred in June 2021, when a sharp drop in the price of the assets used to back a stablecoin set off a negative feedback loop of stablecoin redemptions and further price declines,\" she said.",

             "In feudal Japan, the term ronin was used to describe a Japanese samurai without a master. Left alone due to the death of his lord, or loss of his privilege, a ronin was a warrior adrift, roaming at large, free from the constraints of loyalty. Expressed by two characters that literally mean floating and man, the term in Japanese culture invokes a sense of tragedy and failure, a disgraced entity at the edge of society. Today, the Japanese use it to describe students who failed their college entrance exam and must try again, living masterless until they pass.",
             "This is where the Ronin blockchain gets its name. Built and owned by the Vietnamese game development studio, Sky Mavis, Ronin is a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum designed specifically to overcome the scaling challenges experienced by the developer's first blockchain game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis founder Trung Nguy\u1ec5n created it after the original Ethereum scaling application Axie was built on, the Loom network, abandoned the gaming sector to focus on enterprise blockchain instead.",
             "What Nguy\u1ec5n and his team built was a robust sidechain, which has proven itself independent and impenetrable thus far. Unlike the traditional trope, however, Nguy\u1ec5n\u2019s Ronin could never completely go it alone, as its users still need to be able to interact with other blockchains. As such, it was the \u201cbridge\u201d that connects Ronin to the main Ethereum network that was exploited for 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USDC worth over $625 million in total at the time of the attack last month, one of the largest crypto heists to date.",
             "While the attack was obviously a direct hit on Sky Mavis, its broader implications demonstrate how these floating protocols are actually deeply connected through common membership to the decentralized ecosystem and the universal need for interoperability. If they respond in solidarity, this crisis may be reframed as an opportunity for the community to rebuild better together.",
             "\u201cI was shocked and sad but then immediately became calm because it\u2019s the only way to get through this effectively,\u201d Nguy\u1ec5n told me over Discord, when I asked about his immediate reaction to the hack. Since then, the company has announced a $150 million funding round led by Binance that \u2013 combined with Sky Mavis' balance sheet funds \u2013 will be used to reimburse all users affected by the Ronin Validator Hack. That kind of emergency funding must be a huge relief to a founder at the center of one of the biggest blockchain-based burglaries in history, but even before he had that guarantee, Nguy\u1ec5n maintained his composure.",
             "Through removing emotions and \u201cover communicating every single step\u201d to each other, Nguy\u1ec5n said his colleagues are able to feel a greater sense of control and become a source of reliability for others. From there, a sense of assurance amplifies throughout the team, he said.",
             "In spite of all the recent challenges, Sky Mavis is still forging ahead with the launch of its new game, Origin, which is an evolution of their first release. The mood in the Vietnam office right now is one of stoic resolve, Nguy\u1ec5n told me.",
             "\u201cWe were hesitant that we wouldn't have enough resources to support the Origin launch and scalability,\u201d Nguy\u1ec5n admitted. \u201cHowever we trust both the incident and Origin teams to handle whatever issues may arise,\u201d he said. Some might say Nguy\u1ec5n has nearly impossible standards; he has taken years to build an all-star team that he feels he can trust and rely on.",
             "After the hack was announced, my Twitter feed lit up. Plenty of obvious backers came out to demonstrate their support for Axie\u2019s core team, but it was Axie\u2019s competitors that truly set the tone. Corey Wilton, creator of the popular blockchain game Pegaxy, tweeted that he felt \u201cvery very sad\u201d and acknowledged the immense pressure upon the Sky Mavis team.",
             "Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of Immutable X, a layer 2 scaling product for Ethereum that competes with Ronin in the blockchain gaming sector, tweeted that his thoughts were \u201calso with Axie\u201d and said he was confident they would recover from the crisis.",
             "Kieran Warwick, co-founder of the upcoming game, Illuvium, which is built on Immutable X, has been a particularly vocal critic of Axie Infinity in the past. But upon news of the hack, he dropped his competitive streak to show comradery instead. \u201cCompetition is great, but nobody likes to see something like this happen,\u201d he tweeted.",
             "This is a stark contrast to recent times, when the Axie FUD has sometimes been deafening. Along with the spectacular crash of SLP, Axie\u2019s in-game reward token, from an all-time high of just over $0.39 in July 2021, to a low of $0.015 in March 2022, we\u2019ve witnessed the general sentiment for play-to-earn gaming turn from dizzyingly sensationalist to deeply scrutinous.",
             "Likewise, the news headlines turned from proclamations of poverty alleviation and economic empowerment to questions of ethics and exploitation.",
             "Today, there are more than 398 blockchain games being played worldwide, and $5.4 billion in funding has poured into the space, led by heavyweight VCs, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. The sector has gone from niche to normie, with the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) reporting a 186% growth in its membership base between 2020 and 2021. The industry organization now boasts over 473 members, including gaming studios, blockchain protocols and individuals within the community, but pre-Axie times, there were very, very few interested in the intersection between blockchain and gaming.",

Even the game\u2019s scholarship model \u2013 where players can rent their Axie creatures out to others \u2013 was once revolutionary, demonstrating the most interesting use case the world had ever seen in terms of the utility of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Now, the feature is basically standard across all blockchain games and underpins the entire concept of decentralized gaming guilds, a new business model that acts as an on-ramp for Web 3 newcomers who don\u2019t own their own NFTs.",
             "While these guilds now represent hundreds of NFT games and blockchain-based virtual worlds, all of them began with Axie.",
             "The Ronin exploit shows that even rivals can and should put aside their differences in times of crisis. While competition fuels innovation and serves to advance the adoption of Web 3, so might solidarity. A security breach isn\u2019t good for anyone, and a hack of this proportion stains the entire industry, which could cause would-be players, partners and investors to stay away.",
             "Particularly as this definitely will not be the last exploit; a hack like this could happen to any of us, at any time. It is a shared fear and responsibility for us all. Some forward-thinking VCs have stepped up to aid Sky Mavis this time, but it will take more than money to ensure the future of Web 3 is safe and secure. Through genuine collaboration, sharing of information, lending support and demonstrating confidence in fellow builders \u2013 the industry can and will survive.",
             "In this way, all of us in Web 3 are ronins. While the ronin was without a lord, he was never alone. The ronin banded together, skirting traditional hierarchies of social organization to form a decentralized, leaderless collective of their own. Like-minded loners who failed to fit with conventional expectations, opting to create their own shared spaces at the fringes of society instead. On their own, the ronin were vulnerable, but together, they became much greater than the sum of their parts. Together, they \u2013 and we in Web 3 \u2013 will be stronger than before.",

             "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a proposal to, among other things, require \u201ccommunication protocol systems\u201d (or CPSs) to register with the agency and thereafter satisfy its many recordkeeping, transaction-monitoring and reporting obligations. These CPSs would be defined as systems or platforms that \u201cmake available\u201d the means for buyers and sellers of securities to \u201cinteract.\u201d",
             "Concern has swept across crypto that this broad and novel regulatory approach would bring crypto, and decentralized finance (DeFi) in particular, into the SEC\u2019s regulatory perimeter. In that world, we could see a steady drumbeat of enforcement actions that would dramatically redefine the risk profile of running a U.S.-based crypto project.",
             "It is imperative that each and every participant in the U.S. crypto market let their voice be heard. The SEC is accepting comments on its proposal through April 18 and cannot finalize the rule until each and every concern is considered and addressed. And concerns abound.",
             "There are, of course, two threshold issues. First, which tokens, if any, are actually securities? On that long-standing issue, this proposal is silent. Second, did the SEC even intend to rope crypto into this proposed regulatory regime? Nothing in the 654-page rule mentions crypto, DeFi or blockchain protocols generally, and so there is room for doubt.",
             "The SEC could resolve all our concerns by simply and expressly disclaiming that crypto is implicated. One hopes it chooses that path.",
             "Under Chairman Gary Gensler's leadership, the agency has signaled its intention to take on greater oversight of crypto. The key question has been how. Legislative, rulemaking and even enforcement approaches have been options for pulling crypto within the agency\u2019s purview. If this proposal signifies the SEC\u2019s first effort at such rulemaking, it presents the industry many bones to pick.",
             "Foremost among these concerns is whether this rule exceeds the SEC\u2019s authority. The SEC regulates exchanges, which traditionally has meant platforms where buyers and sellers actually buy and sell, but not ancillary services or platforms. This rule expands that perimeter to platforms where buyers and sellers might merely talk about buying and selling. That\u2019s a huge change, and arguably one that the SEC doesn\u2019t have congressional permission to make.",
             "Beyond that, the rule is simply impractical. It requires someone who \u201cmakes available\u201d a CPS to register. What \u201cmakes available\u201d means is a mystery.",
             "That problem is compounded in DeFi, the crypto subsector that looks to reinvent financial services without middlemen. Decentralized lending, exchange and information platforms are sometimes built by loose, international collectives of coders and maintained by global online communities.",
             "Are we really supposed to believe that software developers who contribute to open-source projects are to register with the SEC because the platform may facilitate buyers and sellers talking? How would a community register or who among its members would register? Who is held accountable for recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting when there is no centralized authority? This proposal highlights the inherent problems with imposing a central-authority-dependent regulatory scheme on disintermediated systems.",
             "Moreover, rules must be issued according to a specific process, and the process in this instance is deficient in a number of respects.",
             "First, the SEC needs to give adequate notice and opportunity to comment. Mere weeks to comment on a 654-page proposal that massively expands secondary market securities regulation and may also encompass crypto (without ever mentioning crypto) is anything but adequate.",
             "Second, the SEC\u2019s proposal must analyze the costs and benefits of the rule, including from an economic perspective. That analysis is missing, which is not hard to believe given the proposal\u2019s breadth and ambiguity.",
             "Such analysis would show the costs to the growing U.S. crypto ecosystem are plain. Homegrown DeFi projects would be incentivized to leave the U.S. (which would be the same result as if DeFi projects were explicitly banned). U.S. citizens would lose access to platforms that are proving to be more efficient, fair and accessible than traditional financial services, and the agency would create, perhaps inadvertently, a regulatory moat that shores up the primacy of big financial incumbents.",
             "If those shortcomings weren\u2019t enough, this proposal is also at odds with the First Amendment. As written, the proposal would regulate speech based on its content, which is presumptively unconstitutional. The SEC arguably must have a compelling interest to regulate speech in such a way and must make the regulatory boundaries very bright lines. Neither appears to be the case. This is a fatal flaw. So too is the procedural failure to wrestle anywhere in the proposal with the implications for free speech.",
             "The SEC has a very tough job regulating secondary markets in securities. The effort to address technological developments, to provide legal clarity and to bolster market competition by leveling the regulatory landscape should be applauded.",
             "But when the effort falls short, the problems must be listed and addressed. U.S. law provides us with that opportunity, and between now and April 18, we must seize it by making our voices heard. Clearly, formidably but politely, each of us must ask the SEC to explicitly exclude crypto from the scope of the final rule.",

             "What are these bots doing? Many are cruising the web indexing web pages, making it easier to find content. Others are doing \u201cbad bot\u201d things like trying to hack into sites. Yet more are clicking on ads.",

             "It\u2019s those ad-clicking bots that are a symptom of the problem plaguing media today. Click fraud is profitable because clicks generate payouts from ad networks. But as the volume of traffic surges, the value of each click falls. So the scale of traffic required to support actual journalism and publishing becomes ever larger.",
             "The ad-fraud researcher Augustine Fou has a great chart titled \u201cNot Humans, Something Else.\u201d It plots the total number of internet users in the U.S. since 2004 against annual digital ad spending. Ad spend rockets upwards and to the right, far outpacing the number of internet users. To whom are advertisers showing all those ads? Probably bots.",
             "What to do about all those bots reading your carefully crafted and edited articles? And, more importantly, how do publishers get paid if bots siphon away valuable human attention and depress ad rates? Blockchains solve this \u2013 well, at least partially.",
             "For blockchains to work at all, they have to solve the same problem facing publishers trying to figure out whether their audience is human or robot: Sybil attacks. A Sybil attack is when a pseudonymous actor spins up multiple identities to overwhelm a network. The Bitcoin blockchain solves this by requiring nodes to pay a \u201ctax on identity creation\u201d without sacrificing pseudonymity, as the authors of the excellent Princeton textbook \u201cBitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\u201d put it. This is Bitcoin\u2019s famous \u201cproof of work\u201d Sybil-resistance mechanism.",
             "(Augustine Fou)",
             "Similarly, we can imagine sprinkling some Web 3, blockchain-enabled magic on media models to create Sybil-resistant media. One of the simplest mechanisms for this is showing a reader content only if they hold some token, or a sum of tokens, in their crypto wallet.",
             "This type of token-gated media model doesn\u2019t presume the type of token: FWB, which is not just \u201cSoHo House without the house,\u201d but also publishes several streams of journalism, operates with a fungible FWB token. Meanwhile, a project like Unlock Protocol offers token-gating behind non-fungible tokens (NFT).",
             "But because tokens are needed to reveal content means the tax on would-be Sybil attackers rises. What\u2019s more, as the publisher gains popularity its token should rise in value, therefore levying a heavier tax on non-human readers. This aligns the interests of reader and publisher, cutting out the bot-enabled middlemen.",
             "The notion of Sybil-resistant media isn\u2019t just a blockchain pipedream. More traditional media businesses (TradMedia?) are also coming around to the idea that small is better. Instead of the venture-capital backed mass audiences of yore \u2014 think of venture darling BuzzFeed (BZFD) and how its stock price fell off a cliff once public markets could evaluate it. There\u2019s now a case for smaller but more lucrative audiences.",
             "This is the \u201cprimary engagement media,\u201d which the analyst Brian Morrissey has championed lately. Morrissey says publishers that adopt this model will go deep and narrow rather than wide and shallow. Crucially, this form of media will also be sufficiently influential to get readers to do stuff \u2013 whether that\u2019s buying things from a publisher\u2019s e-commerce platform or re-upping a subscription.",
             "The canonical example of primary engagement media done right is the \"Not Boring\" author Packy McCormick, who, perhaps predictably, has also morphed into a crypto thought leader and investor. He cultivates an audience through his newsletter, creates hugely influential sponsored deep-dives for that audience, and also gets his readers to invest in his fund. That\u2019s a lot of primary engagement for a solo operator. And you\u2019re not exactly seeing BuzzFeed getting [liquidity providers] for its latest GameFi fund from its readership.",
             "What types of Sybil-resistant crypto media do we have today? For starters, many such projects shy away from using the word \u201cmedia\u201d at all. They might call themselves decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), communities or some other variation of those words.",
             "The aforementioned FWB is one example. Hold a certain balance of FWB tokens and you get access to its hot events and in-the-know chat. But what\u2019s less talked about is its editorial division, which was one of the first things the group spun up, even before its now legendary parties.",
             "FWB editorial now comprises feature stories in the form of Works in Progress, or WIP, ranging from \u201can oral history of Crypto Coven\u201d to an extended metaphor on how Alcoholics Anonymous is really an 86-year-old DAO. It also publishes a weekly newsletter called TL;DR, which is essentially a form of local journalism (you need 1 FWB to read it). Instead of journalists covering different community boards or town hall meetings, writers discuss what went down on the FWB Discord server\u2019s warren of channels, threads and voice chats.",
             "Water and Music, founded by journalist Cherie Hu, is another crypto media outfit that benefits from primary engagement. It co-writes research reports with dozens of its community members on how technology is changing the music industry, paying them in its own STREAM token. (Disclosure: I advised Water and Music as part of my contribution to the Seed Club accelerator.) You can join the community (read: Discord server) by paying a good old-fashioned subscription, but then take part in things like co-writing reports using the token. Water & Music has 1,500 paying subscribers, and they\u2019re mostly people whose jobs are affected by tech in music.",
             "Forefront is another content-heavy project that eschews the \u201cmedia\u201d label, preferring instead to call itself a \u201cport of entry\u201d to Web 3. It publishes a podcast, hosts a data offering, and sends out a weekly newsletter. Like Water & Music, it rewards contributors in its FF token, and you become a community member by holding some FF to begin with.",
             "While the Web 2 media world is still grappling with a shift to reader-supported business models, crypto media can show the way with Web 3-enabled features. It can swap proprietary paywalls with universally readable wallets. It can turn passive readers into active co-creators with token incentives. And it can tell both the unfolding story of crypto media as it is creating it themselves. I\u2019d like to see a bot make sense of that.",

             "On March 23, $620 million was stolen from the blockchain network associated with Axie Infinity, a crypto-backed video game.",
             "The vulnerability has to do with the structure of the game itself, which revolves around real money \u2013 non-fungible tokens (NFT) \u2013 rather than your standard in-game currency. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as a \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d model: Playing the game can actually make you money, if you play your cards right.",
             "Rather than operating directly on the tried and true Ethereum network, Axie Infinity uses a custom-built sidechain called Ronin \u2013 essentially an Ethereum spin-off meant to reduce congestion on the main chain. In order to interact with applications built on Ronin, you\u2019ll need to port your crypto over to the network using a specialized program called a \u201cbridge.\u201d",
             "This was the site of last month\u2019s exploit. Blockchain networks are notoriously difficult to mess with, in and of themselves \u2013 it\u2019s when you\u2019re moving money between networks that cracks start to form. An attacker managed to steal around $610 million from Poly Network last year by going after the bridge. And just two months ago, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Wormhole had its bridge hacked to the tune of $325 million.",
             "In the case of Axie/Ronin, the company behind the network didn\u2019t even notice the hack for about a week. Or if it did, it decided to take its time in formally announcing it: A blog post revealing the losses went up on March 29, six full days after the attacker made off with the funds.",
             "\u201cThis is when we show what we're made of,\u201d tweeted Axie co-founder Jeff Zirlin at the time. \u201cChaos is a ladder.\u201d (The apparent \u201dGame of Thrones\u201d reference was not explained.)",
             "This sort of dug-in flippancy has more or less been the mentality of the Axie Infinity team. The Ronin bridge remains down, which means Axie players can\u2019t actually withdraw their crypto from the network, but top brass has apparently decided the show must go on. Sky Mavis, the company responsible for Axie Infinity, has said it plans to reimburse players for their lost funds. It also delayed the game\u2019s next big upgrade, titled \u201cAxie Infinity: Origin,\u201d by a week.",
             "But as Axie looks to retain its status as the single largest play-to-earn ecosystem on any blockchain, security issues may be the least of its worries.",
             "Back in December, Zirlin described Axie Infinity\u2019s play-to-earn mechanics as a kind of liberation for the world of online gaming.",
             "\u201cAll we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve added a system of property rights into games,\u201d he told me, referencing the idea that players can actually \u201cown\u201d Axie NFTs on the blockchain. \u201cSo, in some ways, we\u2019ve freed people. We\u2019ve given them something that they should have had all along.\u201d",
             "In practice, though, Axie is a lesson in the dangers of play-to-earn.",
             "While the game can make you money, it can also create debts. Playing the game requires a starting roster of three Axie NFTs, which can only be acquired on the secondary market. Players who can\u2019t afford those initial NFTs (typically costing a couple hundred dollars) turn to Axie \u201cscholarship\u201d programs, wherein wealthy benefactors front the buy-in in exchange for a cut of the profits.",
             "Call it a gray market system \u2013 it\u2019s not officially sanctioned by Sky Mavis, but in countries like Venezuela and the Philippines, it has become a common mode of interacting with the game. Some popular lenders take as much as two-thirds of the total profits, per the data aggregator CoinGecko.",
             "It\u2019s part of why, according to a report from the research firm Naavik, the majority of Filipino Axie players are still making below the country\u2019s average minimum wage. Stephen Diehl, a prominent crypto critic, likened it to \u201cdigital serfdom,\u201d though I think that may be slightly misstating it. It\u2019s more like an especially predatory employment contract \u2013 a full-time job with extremely poor returns.",
             "\u201cThe scholar grinds daily, you split the profits,\u201d one scholarship manager told Motherboard. \u201cEverybody wins!\"",
             "This sort of attitude makes the \u201cserfdom\u201d analog easy to grok. Sky Mavis was valued at $3 billion this past fall, and is backed by the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. As with any other crypto unicorn, there\u2019s money to be made through speculation. Affiliated tokens AXS and SLP (smooth love potion) can be traded on decentralized exchanges outside of the game and have generated massive market capitalizations.",
             "Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s business model \u2013 which has already been criticized for its resemblance to a Ponzi scheme \u2013 relies heavily on this army of low-wage workers. They create value at the lowest level of the system (the game itself), most of which then flows out of their hands. It reflects an explicit power hierarchy: Those who start with the most money will always end up making the most money.",
             "A socialist might say that\u2019s how many jobs already work. The difference is in the rhetoric: Zirlin claims to have \u201cfreed\u201d his players when he has essentially recreated an existing, exploitative system on the blockchain.",
             "This was the promise of Uber, too \u2013 the idea that anyone could be a driver, with an increased degree of flexibility. You didn\u2019t need a medallion from the Taxi and Limousine Commission and you could effectively set your own hours. Drivers understood they were employees, but Uber didn\u2019t see it that way; it used a massive ad campaign to persuade California voters to vote \u201cyes\u201d on a proposition that would exclude in-state gig workers from certain labor laws, and had no trouble getting its way.",
             "As Axie Infinity scrambles to recover from the Ronin bridge hack, it\u2019s putting its other fundamental issues on the back burner. There\u2019s nothing inherently liberatory about the blockchain.",

             "Crypto philanthropy differs significantly from traditional ways of giving. These differences are changing donor demographics, funding models and even the reasons for giving.",
             "The rising frequency of these crypto donations suggest this method of giving will play an enduring role in the nonprofit sector and perhaps transform philanthropy. The availability of crypto for giving has already spurred new waves of younger people to consider philanthropy and helped smaller charities compete for donations, but these may only be first steps as digital assets embed themselves more firmly in our lives.",
             "Tanvi Ratna is the CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on policy approaches for digital assets.",
             "Last year was the largest ever for crypto donations by far. According to Fidelity Charitable, the financial services giant\u2019s nonprofit that advises donors on charitable giving, around 45% of cryptocurrency investors donated to charities in 2020, compared to 33% of general investors. Fidelity Charitable received around $331 million in cryptos compared to $28 million in 2020. In its annual report, Giving Block, a crypto donation platform, reported $69 million in total donation volume last year, a massive 1,558% spike from 2020.",
             "The ease of transferring cryptos to any part of the world allows charitable organizations to have donors globally. Many international charity organizations have started accepting crypto donations. UNICEF launched a new financial vehicle, CryptoFund, to deal with cryptocurrencies. Big organizations such as the Red Cross and Greenpeace have also started accepting crypto.",
             "Crypto donations help nonprofits that are unable to get funding due to government restrictions. In 2010, WikiLeaks, an international non-profit that publishes news leaks was blacklisted by the U.S. Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) blocked its funding. Now, WikiLeaks receives millions in crypto donations. Despite this unprecedented growth, cryptocurrency philanthropy remains a niche form of giving and differs from traditional approaches in many ways.",
             "The pool of cryptocurrency users is, on average, much younger than traditional donors to philanthropy. Over 60% of cryptocurrency users are under the age of 40. In the U.S., the average age of crypto users is 38 whereas the average age of donors is 64.",
             "United Way, an international charity organization, started accepting crypto in 2014. Analytics data from its website show that the average user is 45 to 65 years old and 80% are female. Meanwhile, the average age of visitors to United Way\u2019s crypto donation site is 25 to 35 years old and 80% are male. Cryptocurrency is drawing younger people to philanthropy in large numbers.",
             "Similarly, social media became a COVID-19 helpline with global reach when India struggled with the second wave of the pandemic, also leading to crypto donations. Among the donors was Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who gave around $1 billion to India\u2019s COVID-19 relief in shiba inu (SHIB) tokens that soared in value around the same time.",
             "In 2021, the Tor Project, a popular non-profit for internet freedom and privacy, received 58% of its donations in cryptocurrencies. This largesse reflected crypto donors\u2019 affinity for such causes as data privacy compared to others.",
             "To be sure, some crypto donors may often be puzzled about which non-profit or cause they should support. But this challenge is common in philanthropy.",
             "Recently, Giving Bock has introduced impact index funds or cause funds. These funds will help donors make informed decisions and potentially open them to a wider range of opportunities than they might otherwise have consider..",
             "Traditional philanthropy has focused more on popular non-profits. Many donors have been more inclined to international charity organizations skilled in communicating their success, but the trend may be costing smaller and equally outstanding organizations who could also use the support.",
             "Cause-based funds on crypto donation platforms cover different areas including education, disaster relief, food and the environment. Donors can support a particular cause rather than choosing a specific non-profit organization with the non-profits receiving an equal share of the donated amount. This structure gives smaller non-profits equal footing, and ensures that the wider cause receives more attention than larger, more popular non-profits.",
             "Donors may find crypto philanthropy appealing for various reasons. Crypto investors can avoid capital gains tax through donations. Donating long-term appreciated assets directly can also unlock additional funds for charity, and there are potential savings for donors and non-profits on transaction fees that are embedded in traditional financial services platforms.",
             "Transaction costs for receiving crypto donations areless than those for credit or debit card, which was the preferred method of giving for 63% of donors worldwide, according to the 2020 \"Global Trends in Giving Report.\" According to Charity Navigator, the processing fee on credit card transactions \u2013 a direct deduction from the charity amount \u2013 can range from 2.2% to 7.5%.",
             "Meanwhile, a normal wire transfer of $2,000 from the U.S. to India may cost $30 to $50 extra in transaction charges. The gas fees for the same amount when transferred through the Ethereum blockchain can be around $10 to $15. Moreover, there are other blockchains with even smaller fees. Also, the transaction time in crypto can be as low as a few seconds or minutes, whereas, cross border transfer of fiat takes hours or even a few days.",
             "Donating cryptocurrencies to non-profits is tax deductible in the U.S. U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other countries. However, converting crypto to fiat can trigger capital gain taxes.",
             "By donating a long-term appreciated asset directly, an investor can deduct the fair market value of the crypto at the time of a contribution. For example, If you bought your crypto for $1,000 and it appreciated to $2,000, you can deduct the $2,000 value.",
             "If you convert $2,000 to fiat, you have to write off 20% of $2,000 paid in taxes from the donation amount. As a result, investors can save at least 20% to 30% on taxes.",
             "Nonprofits find it easier to target existing donors than to find new donors. As a result, donors often prefer to remain anonymous as the pressure to give increases. Similarly, donating a big amount may require the completion of know-your-customer (KYC) and other personal identification requirements.",
             "Donating in crypto helps donors preserve their anonymity even while donating millions of dollars. However, such anonymity might not last long as many countries increase their crypto regulations.",
             "As of 2021, more than 1,300 nonprofits accepted crypto donations. Crypto philanthropy is inspiring young people to give by enabling direct donations and cause-based impact investing in unprecedented ways. In turn, the switch from organization-focused to cause-based funding will encourage crypto adoption among small nonprofits. These changes could open a new world of opportunity for nonprofits and disrupt traditional forms of giving.",
